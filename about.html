          I study mechatronics engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am also pursuing a minor in cognitive science.
          <span class="brmedium">
          I have a keen interest in software development and I'm dipping my toes into the machine learning space.
          </span>
            Currently, I'm a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.connected.io" target="_blank">Connected</a> working on backend and mobile platforms. 
            Previously, I was a software engineering intern at <a href="https://global.toyota/en/" target="_blank">Toyota</a> and <a href="https://cognixion.com/" target="_blank">Cognixion</a> where I worked on developing a <a href="http://one.cognixion.com/" target="_blank">brain-computer interface headset</a>.

            I love to get involved at my school and my community. In the past, I have co-founded a local Women in STEM club for young female students to promote involvement in STEM careers. 
            I am also a director of the Waterloo Engineering Society where I have helped to organize a hackathon for 300+ students around North America. I also helped to design and develop the hackathon website in <a>Figma</a>, <a>React.js</a>, and <a>TypeScript</a>, which you can find <a href="http://enghack.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

          <span class="brmedium">
            I am also an executive on the Waterloo Data Science Club. My team and I are the founding members of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4r1GMei94NFMEMTi6ErvEk?si=pjGHQ1RrRAG18qQ4N7iPaw&dl_branch=1" target="_blank">Unlabelled Unstructured</a>, a tech focused podcast where we talk about recent trends and industry news with guest speakers. 
            Past guests we've had on are Dhaval Patel, a YouTuber with a channel of 400k+ subscribers, Henry Shi, CEO of Snapcommerce.

          <span class="brmedium">
            Right now, I am a team lead at <a href="https://www.watolink.com" target="_blank">WATOLINK</a>, an engineering design team focused on developing a brain-computer interface application to translate brain signals into user commands on an interface. 
            We will be competing in the NeuroTechX 2022 competition.
